</div>

## TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create a new repository using this template.
2. **Title:** Change the first line of this README to the name of your project.
3. **Badges:** In the badges section above, change the repo name in each URL. If you are creating something other than a Rust crate, remove the crates.io and docs badges (and feel free to add more appropriate ones for your language).
4. **Issue & PR Templates**: Review the files in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`. Adapt them
   to suit your needs, removing or re-wording any sections that don't make sense for your use case.
5. **CHANGELOG.md:**

- Keep Unreleased section at the top to track upcoming changes.
- At release time, move the Unreleased section changes into a new release version section.
- Keep to the format and use semantic version for logs.
- New change logs should come first after the Unrealeased section (see example).

6. **Cleanup:** Remove this section of the README and any unused files from the repo.
